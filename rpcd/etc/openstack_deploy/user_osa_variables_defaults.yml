# TODO(evrardjp): Move this to group_vars/all/osa.yml when
# OSA has overridable group vars AND pkg_locations becomes a group
# var. Alternatively, we can remove this variable when all
# our roles will be outside /opt/rpc-openstack/
# This var lists the locations for the package builder to
# look for files that contain pip packages and git repos to build from
pkg_locations:
  - /opt/openstack-ansible
  - /etc/ansible/roles
  - /etc/openstack_deploy
  - /opt/rpc-openstack/rpcd

# When we build python/container artifacts we pull the default LXC cache
# variant from LXC upstream which may have packages installed which are more
# recent than those we have available in our artifacted apt repository. Here
# we figure out which packages are installed, but not available in a
# configured source, then we downgrade them to the latest available in the
# configured sources.
#
# By way of reference, typically the output of 'apt list --installed' will
# produce output such as the following:
#
# adduser/trusty,now 3.113+nmu3ubuntu3 all [installed]
# ca-certificates/r14.0.0rc1-trusty,now 20160104ubuntu0.14.04.1 all [installed]
# libc6/now 2.19-0ubuntu6.11 amd64 [installed,local]
# libglib2.0-0/r14.0.0rc1-trusty,now 2.40.2-0ubuntu1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
#
# The format of the output is the following:
# <package name>/<list of dist sources> <version> <arch> <flags>
#
# If a package is flagged as 'installed' and 'local' then it indicates that
# the package has been installed from an apt source which is not currently
# configured. These are the packages which need to be downgraded to a version
# in an available apt source.
